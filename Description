A simple OrderBook Simulator

When a limit order for price P and volume V is entered into the market, it will immediately trade against any orders on the opposite 
side that have a price better than P (e.g. Less than or equal to P if it's a buy order, or greater than or equal to P if it's a
sell order), until either V lots have traded or there are no orders left that it can trade with. If the order has any volume left 
over after it has traded against all viable orders, it will enter the market and stay there until another order trades with its 
remaining volume.Incoming orders trade against the best prices on the opposite side first
Example:
    Starting orderbook:
        Order	Side	Price	Volume
        A		Sell	10.2		50
        B		Sell	10.1		5
        C		Sell	10.1		30
        D		Buy		10.0		100

    A buy order arrives for 20 lots at a price of 10.1. It trades entirely against order C and never enters the orderbook.
    C's volume is reduced by 20 lots:
        Order	Side	Price	Volume
        A		Sell	10.2		50
        B		Sell	10.1		5
        C		Sell	10.1		10
        D		Buy		10.0		100
